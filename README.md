OpenMovies is a platform that provides users with a curated selection of the best movies in each genre, using data from IMDB. Whether you're looking for the latest blockbuster or a classic masterpiece, our platform makes it easy to find the perfect movie for any occasion.

The project includes various files that work together to make this platform functional. These files are organized into different directories:

config: This directory contains the configuration files for the project. These files define the settings for the application and allow for easy customization.

controllers: The controllers handle the logic for the routes. They connect the routes to the models and views, and define the behavior of the application.

middleware: This directory contains the middleware functions that are used for authentication or other functionality. Middleware functions are used to process requests and responses, and to perform actions such as authentication and validation.

migrations: This directory contains the migration files which are used to set up and update the database. Migrations are used to change the structure of the database, and to ensure that the database is in a consistent state.

models: The models handle the data, such as querying the database and creating new entries. They define the structure of the data and provide methods for interacting with the database.

routes: The routes handle the incoming HTTP requests and define what to do with them. They define the behavior of the application in response to different types of requests.

samples/csv: This directory contains sample CSV files used for populating the database. The CSV files can be used to insert data into the database, and can also be used as a reference for the structure of the data.

views: The views handle the presentation of the data, such as rendering HTML templates. They define the structure of the pages and provide methods for displaying data.

README.md: This file provides a description of the project and instructions on how to use it.

package-lock.json: This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. This file is used to lock the dependencies versions for the project.

package.json: This file contains the dependencies for the project. It lists all the packages required for the project to run and their version numbers.

server.js: This file is the entry point of the application and runs the server. It sets up the server and starts listening for incoming requests.

To run the project, you should have Node.js and npm installed. You can then install the dependencies by running npm install and start the server by running npm start.
